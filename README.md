# WebKitten
A Web UI and CLI Package for LogKitten

# Setup
WebKitten relies on ssh to watch the logkitten file. For the sake of WebKitten's simplicity, you must have an ssh config entry on the machine that will serve WebKitten that sets the `IdentityFile` option. Passwords are not and won't ever be supported by WebKitten.
